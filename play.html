      <h4>Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W</h4>
      <pre>
        [Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has
        ceased, Algernon enters.]
        
        ALGERNON.
        Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
        
        LANE.
        I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.
        
        ALGERNON.
        I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
        play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
        piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.
        
        LANE.
        Yes, sir.
        
        ALGERNON.
        And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
        sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
        
        LANE.
        Yes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]
        
        ALGERNON.
        [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the
        way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
        Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
        champagne are entered as having been consumed.
        
        LANE.
        Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
        
        ALGERNON.
        Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
        drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.
